    "\n",
    "That computer can be in the \"cloud\" â€” meaning it's at a data center somewhere but you can use it. There are [lots of options](https://course.fast.ai/index.html). I like to use use [the Amazon EC2 setup](https://course.fast.ai/start_aws.html), which is probably the most complicated. In most of these cases, you'll just clone [the workshop repository](https://github.com/Quartz/aistudio-workshops) and get the notebook running.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've tailored these notebooks for use with [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), which as of this writing is a fast and *free* way to get going. You essentially \"borrow\" a virual computer in the Google universe to do your calculations.\n"
